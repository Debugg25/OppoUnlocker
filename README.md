This project is not ready for use yet. However any help is greatly appreciated.

OPPO is locking their bootloader and allows unlocking using a depth-testing apk. The aim of this project is to provide a universal solution for any OPPO phone without having to wait 30 days for an unlocked bootloader.
For now this project mostly consists of reversed parts of the depth-testing apk for the Find X2 PRO (PDEM30) so it won't work on any other device.

It also requires manual building of the project because some needed information isn't available to non-root and non-system apps (such as IMEI)

Currently the project is in development, don't expect any ETA or clean code since a lot of SMALI rewriting is needed. Once the app is actually working, I can focus on cleaning up a bit.

Again, this is not working in its current state. If you want it to be finished faster, spin up jadx, decompile the apk and contribute.
